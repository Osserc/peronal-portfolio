# personal-portfolio

Personal portfolio to showcase my creation, made as part of the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/advanced-html-and-css-personal-portfolio)

I had a lot of fun optimizing the layout through media queries and, more importantly, playing around with animations, transformations and transitions.
The aim was to have all elements be interactive, up to a point. I wanted to have the page be alive. I am especially happy with the lighting up on hover, for the buttons in particular.
