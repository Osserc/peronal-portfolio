            <p>Welcome traveler, welcome!</p>
            <p>I am Stefano Rondelli, also known as Osserc around these parts.</p>
            <p>I am philosopher by trade who decided to make a career change and devote himself to the world of programming.</p>
            <p>My interests are philosophy, economics, web development, fitness and nutrition.</p>
            <p>I am familiar with a number of technologies, mainly Ruby and its close friend Ruby on Rails (my favorites), as well as Javascript, CSS and HTML.</p>
            <p>Feel free to peruse some of my projects, and shoot me a message if any tickles your fancy!</p>

            <p>This is the crowning jewel of my Rails projects: a fun spin on Facebook.</p>
            <p>While the theme may seem silly, I had the chance to work on a variety of concepts while building it.</p>
            <p>In particular, it helped me get a good grasp of Turboframes and Turbostreams, as well as solidifying my understanding of relationships.</p>
            <p>I also included some functionalities which I am proud of, like friend and follow suggestions, as well as a specific timeline for follows.</p>
            <p>Go on, take a peek!</p>

            <p>How about a good 'ol game of chess?</p>
            <p>My best and most complex work realized in pure Ruby.</p>
            <p>I especially liked working on this project since I had to flex my problem solving skills to the maximum to solve the challenges I was faced with.</p>
            <p>My favorite part was definitely implementing the move simulation methods, as well as the move reversal methods.</p>
            <p>Grab a seat and make your move!</p>

            <p>As part of learning the Ruby language, I tested my understanding by building a variety of games.</p>
            <p>It has a few different pastimes, like Hangman, Mastermind and Connect 4, of ever increasing complexity.</p>
            <p>In the process of building them, I faced challenges like accounting for win conditions, preventing invalid moves and serializing data.</p>
            <p>I also had a taste of implementing algorithms when it came to make the computer part of Mastermind. Making it guess the code correctly was a good challenge.</p>
            <p>Do check them out.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Working with data can be rather hard without a proper structure behind them.</p>
            <p>These projects were all about organizing data for easier navigation.</p>
            <p>The first two concerned the making of an infrastructure for linked lists and binary search trees.</p>
            <p>The last one, Knight's Travails, required me to apply what I learned to solve the problem of getting a Knight from square A to square B in the least moves possible.</p>
            <p>This meant that I also had to come up with a way to represent a chess board and to validate the moves of the knight, which came in handy when building chess proper.</p>

            </p>
            <p>These are old projects I completed while learning the ropes of programming.</p>
            <p>They rely heavily on Javascript and were excellent for learning methods to manipulate the DOM.</p>
            <p>While less technically demanding, the sketchpad is my favorite, since it taught how to properly connect my scripts to the page.</p>
            <p>The calculator was also nice to build, and while today it would no longer be a challenge, it is a good representation of how I started my coding journey.</p>
            <p>I highly recommend trying out the sketchpad, it's really fun.</p>
